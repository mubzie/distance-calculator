## Project Summary
Distance calculator is a basic Python application that uses the geopy Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) module to calculate the distance between two cities and print out the result to the TERMINAL.

## What is working
- When city and country name is input correctly, you get the desired response. 
- The printout statement is formatted properly to aid visual clarity while viewing the result in the terminal.
## What is not working
- I did not implement input validation. so the input must be valid to get the desired result else you get an error.
## Goal
- To gain an understanding of how modules work in Python
- To create an app that works in the CLI
